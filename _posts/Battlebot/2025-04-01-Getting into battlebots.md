This is the story of me getting into battlebot. The first ever battlebot competition we faced.

few of my friends and I wanted to get into battlebot for long time now. We had few ideas. something like minatour, the brazilian battle bot, the Duck: simple but deadly.

But finally we agreed upon the design somewhat resemble the tombstone.

A horizontal blade infront of the bot with two wheels closed and protected in the back.


we used a transmitter and reciver which normally use to operate drones, a radiolink transmitter as the remote. Actually I was the one who looked into the controlling and programming part while my friends focused more on the design and hardware. which is the hard part.(it's in the name :)

Anyway, the bot is working perfectly, the control is perfect. there few switches to kill the weapon, kill the robot. there is sequence to start up the robot after killing. invert the the control directions incase it get flipped over. 

the day of the competetion came. By the way until now we didn't had a powerful enough power supply to charge the batteries within few minutes. So I had go for search for thoe in the morning. lUckily I did find one. 

My friends had done great job making the robot. the weight limit is 10kg. And our robot is exactly 9.97kg. 

the first round.. it's a flipper. did not seem like that descrutive, the flipper is seem to be slow. so we went to the fight confidently. before even we spin up weapon. it reushed towards us. and fliped us. oh.. the flipper is not slow.we were only fooled. Yeah we lost the round shirtly.

But we have another round. before that we quickly added a iron bar to prevent us from stucking in side ways. I felt the rush of repairing in the middle of the compettion. But we forgot to test the weapon. we did not had time, we went for the next round. 

the round about to start. driver checking the stuff. oh my goodness.. the weapon's not working. we tried restarting.. nope no luck.

fortunately opponents wepaon also malfunctioning. so we easily won the match by pinning them.

we rushed to our desk. what's wrong with the weapon. we started tsting hardware, checking voltages at terminals. is somethign wrong with your program logic or microcontroller. everyone is working, someone removing the covers other one testing the ports with multimeters.. few other people als came to help and now they are holding torches. And I am testing the microcontroller with my laptop. yeah it's working. the issue must be with the motor driver. luckily we had one extra. the organizers are clling us, we got only 2 minutes. motor driver changed. but still not working. oh connections are loose. we didn;t had time to fix the motor driver properly, we hot glued it. no time to test. we assembled our bot quickly. 

We only got the chance to verify the weapon at the areana. yeah it's working. our operator spinned it fully. and went directly to the oponnets wheel. the wheel flied away. their wheel motor shaft got twited. but all that came with a cost. our motor mount was not that strong. so it got snaped and our chain carrying power to the weapon is now free. but luckily it did not damage anything internal. now again its a pushing challenge. 

by the judges decision, we lost the battle. and that was our final battle. 

hoping to take part in more of these.
