This article is based on my experience while trying to build a micromouse. In this article I discuss how to enable OTA(over the air) programming and websocket to update variables.

you can find the documentation for the arduino OTA [here](https://docs.arduino.cc/arduino-cloud/features/ota-getting-started/).
